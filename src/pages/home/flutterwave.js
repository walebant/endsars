  `Hello, I am sending this email because it has come to note that the Flutterwave payment link for donations to the EndSARS campaign has been deactivated by the Central Bank of Nigeria. I want to register my displeasure at this act of censorship and suppression of our voices.

I am an enterprising young Nigerian and a legitimate citizen of the nation, I am a taxpayer and I contribute to the economy meaningfully in my industry.

We are fighting for the most fundamental of human rights, the right to life. Our protests have been peaceful throughout.

The world is watching. Do the right thing. Restore the payment link, and the feminist coalition account and assure us that we are protected under this democracy

Yours sincerely

A concerned Nigerian
